# Credit Risk Classifier

## Overview

This project implements a credit risk classification model to assess the risk level of loan applicants based on financial indicators such as credit score, missed payments, utilization, and debt-to-income ratio. The pipeline includes data ingestion, transformation, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Structure

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ data_ingestion.py        # Loads and splits data into train and test sets
â”œâ”€â”€ data_transformation.py   # Preprocesses and scales the data
â”œâ”€â”€ model_trainer.py         # Trains and evaluates machine learning models
â”œâ”€â”€ training_pipeline.py     # Orchestrates the entire ML pipeline
â”œâ”€â”€ risk_classifier.py       # Classifies individual applicants based on rules
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt         # Dependencies required for the project
â”œâ”€â”€ setup.py                 # Package setup file
â””â”€â”€ best_model.pkl           # Trained model file
```

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd credit-risk-classifier
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the training pipeline:**
   ```sh
   python training_pipeline.py
   ```

## Features

- **Data Ingestion:** Loads the dataset and splits it into train/test sets.
- **Data Transformation:** Prepares and standardizes the data using `StandardScaler`.
- **Model Training:** Uses `RandomizedSearchCV` to optimize models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.
- **MLflow Integration:** Logs model performance and parameters.
- **Risk Classification:** Assigns risk labels based on predefined rules.

## Dependencies

See `requirements.txt` for all required libraries:
- `scikit-learn`
- `mlflow`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `shap`

## Usage

1. **Modify the dataset path** in `data_ingestion.py` if necessary.
2. **Run the training pipeline** to train and evaluate models.
3. **Deploy the trained model** (`best_model.pkl`) for predictions.
