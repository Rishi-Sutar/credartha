# Credit Risk Classifier

## Overview

This project implements a credit risk classification model to assess the risk level of loan applicants based on financial indicators such as credit score, missed payments, utilization, and debt-to-income ratio. The pipeline includes data ingestion, transformation, model training, and evaluation.

```

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd credit-risk-classifier
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the training pipeline:**
   ```sh
   python training_pipeline.py
   ```

## Features

- **Data Ingestion:** Loads the dataset and splits it into train/test sets.
- **Data Transformation:** Prepares and standardizes the data using `StandardScaler`.
- **Model Training:** Uses `RandomizedSearchCV` to optimize models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.
- **MLflow Integration:** Logs model performance and parameters.
- **Risk Classification:** Assigns risk labels based on predefined rules.

## Dependencies

See `requirements.txt` for all required libraries:
- `scikit-learn`
- `mlflow`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`

## Usage

1. **Modify the dataset path** in `data_ingestion.py` if necessary.
2. **Run the training pipeline** to train and evaluate models.
3. **Deploy the trained model** (`best_model.pkl`) for predictions.
